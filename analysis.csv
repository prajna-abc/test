The approach leverages changes in iris and pupil dynamics caused by alcohol's effects on the central nervous system. A new dataset of 3,000 NIR images from 30 volunteers (with and without alcohol) was collected under controlled conditions. The proposed F-CapsNet achieved 92.3% accuracy, outperforming traditional CNNs and SVMs, and is suitable for real-time and mobile deployment due to its reduced parameter count. The study demonstrates the feasibility of camera-based, real-time alcohol impairment detection using NIR imaging.",Alcohol Consumption Detection from Periocular NIR Images Using Capsule Network,2022,ICPR 2022 / arXiv:2209.01657,IR/NIR,"pupil dynamics, iris dynamics, eye-movement, periocular region analysis",alcohol,Yes (algorithm designed for real-time and mobile deployment),"30 subjects, 3,000 NIR images (expanded to 12,000 with augmentation)","Controlled indoor environment (constant lighting, 200 lux, fixed camera distances)",Accuracy (92.3%),⭐⭐⭐,"Directly addresses real-time alcohol impairment detection using NIR camera images and advanced deep learning, with a dedicated dataset and high reported accuracy.","{""dataset"": {""name"": ""IAL-I"", ""availability"": ""Available upon request"", ""composition"": ""30 volunteers (24 male, 6 female), ages 25-50, 5 sessions (pre- and post-alcohol at 15, 30, 45, 60 min), 10 images per eye per session"", ""capture_devices"": [""TD-100 NIR"", ""Iritech NIR""], ""protocol"": ""200ml alcohol (42%) consumed, images captured at intervals""}, ""algorithm"": {""architecture"": ""Fused Capsule Network (F-CapsNet)"", ""feature_extraction"": ""Separate convolutional blocks for alcohol/no-alcohol, fused before capsule layers"", ""parameters"": ""9M (F-CapsNet) vs 18M+ (standard CapsNet)"", ""input_resolution"": ""120x160 grayscale periocular images""}, ""comparisons"": {""baselines"": [{""method"": ""SVM"", ""accuracy"": ""63.5%""}, {""method"": ""Small-VGG CNN"", ""accuracy"": ""73.4%""}, {""method"": ""ArcFace embedding + SVM"", ""accuracy"": ""73.0%""}, {""method"": ""ResNet50"", ""accuracy"": ""73.8%""}]}, ""key_findings"": {""pupil_iris_ratio"": ""Not sufficient alone for reliable alcohol detection due to overlapping distributions"", ""deep learning"": ""F-CapsNet significantly outperforms traditional ML and CNNs for this task""}, ""limitations"": {""non-visual_methods"": ""Not used; focus is exclusively on NIR imaging"", ""generalizability"": ""Dataset size is moderate; further validation in real-world, less controlled settings needed""}, ""visualization"": {""explainability"": ""GradCAM++ used to highlight iris and periocular regions as most relevant for classification""}, ""application"": ""Fitness for Duty (FFD) assessment in safety-critical industries""}"
