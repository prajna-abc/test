  "summary": "This paper presents a method for detecting alcohol consumption using periocular near-infrared (NIR) images and a novel Fused Capsule Network (F-CapsNet) architecture. The approach leverages changes in iris and pupil dynamics caused by alcohol's effects on the central nervous system. A new dataset of 3,000 NIR images from 30 volunteers (with and without alcohol) was collected under controlled conditions. The proposed F-CapsNet achieved 92.3% accuracy, outperforming traditional CNNs and SVMs, and is suitable for real-time and mobile deployment due to its reduced parameter count. The study demonstrates the feasibility of camera-based, real-time alcohol impairment detection using NIR imaging.",
